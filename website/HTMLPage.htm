        User scenarios<br />
        ----------------------<br />
        <br />
        1) Mike is fed up of accidentally pressing Num Lock or Insert - keys<br />
        which he never uses otherwise, but which mess up his typing. He needs<br />
        to have Num Lock set On, though.<br />
        <br />
        2) Sue hates accidentally pressing Caps Lock when she wants Shift. She<br />
        hardly ever uses Caps Lock.<br />
        <br />
        3) Mark in annoyed that his work keyboard doesn&#39;t have hardware volume<br />
        up/down buttons like his Mac keyboard at home.<br />
        <br />
        4) Mary is always looking for her email program and browser in the<br />
        taskbar. She wishes she could just press a button to make them appear<br />
        whether they are open or not.<br />
        <br />
        5) Sandy is frustrated that when using Boot Camp or virtualization to<br />
        run Windows on her Mac that there&#39;s no Print Screen or Scroll Lock<br />
        keys (she uses Excel all the time, and it happens to be the only<br />
        program on Earth that actually takes notice of Scroll Lock). She also<br />
        gets fed up with pressing Command - expecting it to behave like<br />
        Control - when in fact it&#39;s the Windows key and opens the Start Menu.<br />
        <br />
        6) Andy keeps pressing &quot;Power Off&quot; on his Extended Keyboard because<br />
        it&#39;s right next to the Delete key, causing much annoyance and<br />
        inconvenience.<br />
        <br />
        7) Kevin has broken the 6 key on his laptop. He&#39;d like to remap<br />
        another key to it, like F6, rather than have to buy and fit a new<br />
        keyboard.<br />
        <br />
        8) George hates Sarah and wants to mess with her head, so he wants to<br />
        remap half her keys and disables the other half.<br />
        <br />
        Using Key Mapper lets keys be disabled or remapped to other keys.<br />
        Mike can disable Num Lock and Insert completely.<br />
        Sue can remap Caps Lock to Left Shift and Scroll Lock to Caps Lock.<br />
        Mark can make F11 and F12 Volume Down and Up<br />
        Mary can remap F11 to &#39;Email&#39; and F12 to &#39;Browser&#39;<br />
        Sandy can remap one of her function keys to Print Screen and the<br />
        Command key to Control, and so on.<br />
        George gets fired..<br />
        <br />
        Installing and use<br />
        -----------------------<br />
        <br />
        1) Download and run the install program from<br />
        <a href="http://justkeepswimming.net/keymapper/install.html" target="_blank">
        http://justkeepswimming.net<wbr>/keymapper/install.html</a> - this should work<br />
        in Firefox or IE or Safari. You&#39;ll get some warnings about &quot;Unknown<br />
        Publisher&quot; but you know it&#39;s me really.<br />
        2) Run it - it will be under Rose Hill Solutions/Key Mapper in your Start Menu<br />
        3) Drag keys off the virtual keyboard to disable them, or drop them<br />
        onto another key to remap it<br />
        4) If you don&#39;t want to actually create any mappings, clear them<br />
        before exiting the program!<br />
        5) If you have mapped or disabled anything, you have to log off and on<br />
        again so it takes effect.<br />
        <br />
        If you install via this route, you&#39;ll receive updates automatically<br />
        and the install program will check to see you have the program&#39;s<br />
        prerequisites installed. However, each time you run it, you&#39;ll get a<br />
        slightly annoying window first - if that bothers you, use the manual<br />
        install below: if you like, you can use the install page to check the<br />
        prerequisites and then do a manual install from below.<br />
        <br />
        That&#39;s all you really need to know to use the program. Feel free to<br />
        read on though.<br />
        <br />
        More on using the program<br />
        ------------------------------<wbr>--------<br />
        <br />
        To disable a key, drag it off the keyboard.<br />
        Example: Drag Num Lock off the keyboard to disable it<br />
        <br />
        To change what a key does, drop the key you want to replace it with onto it.<br />
        Example: Drag Left Shift onto Caps Lock. Caps Lock will be mapped to Left Shift<br />
        <br />
        To re-enable - or un-map - a mapped or disabled key, drag it off the keyboard.<br />
        <br />
        To disable or remap a key that isn&#39;t on the virtual keyboard, create a<br />
        mapping from the Mappings menu.<br />
        You can either choose the key by pressing it, or from the key lists.<br />
        <br />
        Example: Choose the Power Off key from the lists, then choose Disable.<br />
        <br />
        You can also double-click the key you want to change or disable:<br />
        Example: Double-click on F11, and choose Volume Down from the Media Keys group.<br />
        <br />
        To change a key to one that isn&#39;t in the lists, double-click the key<br />
        then use Capture to set the target.<br />
        Example: To map F5 to the &quot;Have A Cow&quot; button on your Simpsons<br />
        Extended keyboard, double click F5, click the Capture button to start<br />
        capturing, then press the &quot;Have &nbsp;A Cow&quot; button.<br />
        <br />
        To delete a mapping that isn&#39;t visible on the keyboard:<br />
        Show the Mapping List form from Key Mapper&#39;s Windows menu, and click<br />
        Delete next to the mapping you want to remove.<br />
        <br />
        To change the key colours: Show the Colour Map from Key Mapper&#39;s<br />
        Windows menu, then double-click on the key you want to change. Enter<br />
        new values in the Colour Matrix presented or click Random! Right-click<br />
        on the colour map form to reset the colours or show all the buttons.<br />
        <br />
        Do the changes take effect straight away?<br />
        ------------------------------<wbr>--------------------<br />
        <br />
        No. To complete the mapping - or unmapping - you will need to log off<br />
        and log back on again. Using CTRL-ALT-DELETE is the easiest way to log<br />
        off, once you&#39;ve closed things down and saved any documents.<br />
        Restarting will work just as well, and if you&#39;re using Windows 2000<br />
        (or creating Boot mappings which apply to all users) then restarting<br />
        is required instead of logging off.<br />
        <br />
        Why is Key Mapper different from all the other programs that do this?<br />
        ------------------------------<wbr>------------------------------<wbr>----------------------------<br />
        <br />
        They other programs write &#39;boot mappings&#39; (which apply to all users of<br />
        the computer and require a restart to activate) whereas Key Mapper<br />
        allows you to make mappings on a per-user basis - functionality<br />
        Microsoft introduced in Windows XP but forgot to tell anyone about or<br />
        document in any way.<br />
        <br />
        Issues<br />
        -----------<br />
        Some keyboards have extra keys - e.g. Power, Email, Web Browser - and<br />
        the keyboard driver intercepts these keys before they reach Windows,<br />
        which means Key Mapper can&#39;t capture them and Windows can&#39;t remap<br />
        them. If you have a keyboard with these keys, can you try to see if a)<br />
        they can be captured and b) they can be remapped or disabled?<br />
        <br />
        If you use &quot;Fast User Switching&quot; to switch between users, then you&#39;ll<br />
        need to create boot mappings instead of user mappings - as when you<br />
        use Fast User Switching to switch to an existing user then the<br />
        per-user key mappings are lost. This is (in my opinion) a bug in<br />
        Windows, but they would probably say that they never documented the<br />
        per-user mappings anyway so meh.<br />
        <br />
        Installing the program manually<br />
        ------------------------------<wbr>-------------<br />
        <br />
        The RC1 build can be found at<br />
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/keymapper/downloads/list" target="_blank">
        http://code.google.com/p<wbr>/keymapper/downloads/list</a> along with the<br />
        source code used to build it. If you want to build the program<br />
        yourself, use Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Express Edition which is a<br />
        free download.<br />
        <br />
        The program requires the Microsoft .Net Framework to be installed. It<br />
        requires version 2.0, but will happily use 3.0 or 3.5. However, it&#39;s<br />
        likely that most of you won&#39;t have the framework installed (Microsoft<br />
        don&#39;t include it by default) and you&#39;ll need to download it. The later<br />
        versions are bigger: 2.0 is available from<br />
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&amp;displaylang=en" 
            target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com<wbr>/downloads/details.aspx<wbr>?FamilyID=0856EACB-4362-4B0D<wbr>-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&amp;displaylang<wbr>=en</a><br />
        and is 22.4 MB. The .NET framework itself requires Windows Installer<br />
        3.1, if your PC gets automatic updates from Microsoft you&#39;ll already<br />
        have this though.<br />
        <br />
        If you have Vista, the framework is installed by default.<br />
        <br />
        If you run the program without the framework installed you&#39;ll get a<br />
        &quot;Mscoree.dll Could Not Be Found&quot; error.<br />
        <br />
        Why does the program warn me off trying to remap Control, Alt or Delete?<br />
        ------------------------------<wbr>------------------------------<wbr>------------------------------<wbr>-------------------<br />
        <br />
        Because that&#39;s the key sequence you need to log onto Windows. You can<br />
        still do it if you really want to.<br />
        <br />
        What other keys are there I can use for mappings?<br />
        ------------------------------<wbr>------------------------------<br />
        <br />
        There are a whole bunch of keys that can be used in mappings. Some<br />
        simply don&#39;t work (Pause/Break can&#39;t be remapped, the extended power<br />
        functions can&#39;t be used without specific keyboard drivers) and many<br />
        are of limited use, but there are a few which are interesting and<br />
        which work.<br />
        <br />
        Browser and Email &nbsp;Keys<br />
        ------------------------------<wbr>-<br />
        <br />
        As I mentioned above, keys can be mapped for Browser and Email. They<br />
        both invoke your default program, activating a running existence or<br />
        starting a new one as required. This works on all the programs I&#39;ve<br />
        tried - Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Opera for browsers, Outlook<br />
        Express Outlook and Thunderbird for email.<br />
        <br />
        There are also Next and Back and Refresh buttons. If you use Internet<br />
        Explorer, these work whether it is the current application or not, but<br />
        other browsers will only react to these when they are currently<br />
        active.<br />
        <br />
        Media Keys<br />
        -----------------<br />
        <br />
        Volume Down, Up and Mute work whatever program you&#39;re using as they<br />
        are telling Windows to be louder or quieter, not a given application.<br />
        <br />
        Next Track and Previous Track should work in most media programs: if<br />
        you use Windows Media Player, it will switch tracks whether it&#39;s the<br />
        foremost program or in the background, but iTunes only recognizes<br />
        these when it&#39;s the active program.<br />
        <br />
        What else does the program do?<br />
        ------------------------------<wbr>--------<br />
        <br />
        You can toggle the status of Caps, Num and Scroll lock from the menu.<br />
        <br />
        You can explore all the international keyboards installed on your PC<br />
        (quite good fun if you use Vista as lots of exotic locales are<br />
        installed by default)<br />
        <br />
        That&#39;s it?<br />
        ---------------<br />
        <br />
        That&#39;s it. Is there anything else you think it should do? Let me know!</p>
