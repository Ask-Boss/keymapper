<p>One thing that distinguishes Key Mapper from other scancode mapping
programs is that it lets you map or disable keys on a per-user basis:
when Microsoft <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/w2kscan-map.mspx">originally
implemented scancode mappings in Windows 2000</a>, they stated in the
'disadvantages' section:</p>
<blockquote>The mappings stored in the registry work at system level
and apply to all users. These mappings cannot be set to work
differently depending on the current user.</blockquote>
<p>This is because the mappings are stored in <code
class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard
Layout</code> which needs Administrative access to change and is only
loaded at boot time.</p><br /><p>In Windows XP, though, per-user
mappings were quietly introduced, with no fanfare or documentation:
scancode mappings set in the <code
class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout</code> key are
recognised, and apply to an individual user profile. This means that
mappings can be added or removed by logging off and logging back on
again - still inconvenient, but less so than a full reboot: it also
means that mappings can be set up users without Administrative rights.
(Mappings set in <code class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code> are
overridden by those in <code
class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code>).</p><br />
<p>It's possible that Microsoft kept this quiet because user mappings
are incompatible with Fast User Switching: when you switch to an
account that's already logged on, the mappings are not reloaded. It's
also possible that because they kept it quiet, the Fast User Switching
development team didn't realise that user mappings should be reloaded
when switching users. Boot mappings persist through Fast User
Switching.</p><br />
<p>While this is a possible disadvantage to using user mappings, most
people probably don't use more than one account on their computer
anyway, and in computers attached to a domain (i.e. corporate PCs)
which may often be used by different people Fast User Switching isn't
available anyway.</p><br />
<p>There are some other advantages to user mappings:
<ul>
<li>They don't require Administrative rights to be set or removed.</li>
<li>Different users can have different mappings - one can have Caps
Lock disabled but Num Lock enabled, another can have them the other
way round</li>
<li>Keys can be mapped on shared computers without affecting all users</li>
</ul><br />
There is yet another place scancode mappings can be set - in the <code
class="regkey">HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Keyboard Layout</code> key. These
apply at the login prompt, but are then removed when logged in.</p>
